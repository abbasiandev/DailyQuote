## Features

### Cross-Platform Support
- **Shared Business Logic**: The application uses Kotlin Multiplatform to share core business logic between Android and iOS platforms, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistency.
- **Platform-Specific UI**: While the business logic is shared, the UI is implemented natively for each platform (Jetpack Compose for Android and SwiftUI for iOS) to provide a seamless user experience.

### Daily Inspirational Quotes
- **Fetch Daily Quotes**: The app fetches a new inspirational quote every day from a remote API.
- **Caching**: Quotes are cached locally to ensure offline access.

### Favorites Management
- **Save Quotes**: Users can mark quotes as favorites for quick access later.
- **Observe Favorites**: The app uses reactive programming to update the UI whenever the list of favorite quotes changes.

### Offline Support
- **Local Storage**: The app uses a local database to store quotes and user preferences, ensuring functionality even without an internet connection.

## Architecture

The project follows a **Clean Architecture** approach, which separates concerns into distinct layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - **Android**: Built using Jetpack Compose, a modern declarative UI toolkit.
   - **iOS**: Built using SwiftUI, Apple's declarative UI framework.

2. **Domain Layer**:
   - Contains business logic and use cases, such as fetching quotes, managing favorites, and handling notifications.

3. **Data Layer**:
   - **Remote Data Source**: Fetches quotes from a remote API using Ktor.
   - **Local Data Source**: Stores quotes and user preferences locally using Multiplatform Settings and platform-specific storage solutions.
